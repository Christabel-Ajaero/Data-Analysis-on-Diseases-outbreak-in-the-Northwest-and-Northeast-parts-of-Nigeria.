#Diseases-outbreak-Analysis

This is a data analysis project on the disease outbreak in the Northeast and Northwest parts of Nigeria carried out by my fellow team members and I during the GIZ sponsored  boot-camp on Data science and Artificial Intelligence training. The Dataset was gotten from kaggle.com which was initially prepared by Emmanuel Odelanmi who was trying to analyze the outbreak of Meningitis diseases in general using Machine Learning. The aim of project was to counsel the  Ministry of health on the most destructive disease on either male or female gender  with different outcomes in order to find more means to curb it out  for a healthy community.
